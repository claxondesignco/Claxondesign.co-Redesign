## Ethics & Priorities  

<ul class="columns columns-2">  

<li markdown="1" >  

#### Charities  

I support non-profit organizations and charities and offer them reduced rates, including a few pro-bono days a month for design and consulting. If you represent a non-profit or charitable organization, contact me for more information.

#### Social Responsibility  

I support civil rights and will not work with companies or organizations who engage in, promote, or profit from actions or speech that harms or discriminates against marginalized communities.  

</li>
<li markdown="1" >  

#### Honesty  

I work to ensure truthfulness in communication and message, and I don’t work with companies whose messaging is dishonest or misleading.

#### VC&nbsp;Funding  

I hesitate to work with funded startups. It’s nothing personal, I just think projects go better when it’s your own, hard-earned cash on the line.
